The AI engineer successfully enhanced the Evol Jewels kiosk application through a highly iterative process, addressing a continuous stream of user requests and bug fixes. Key accomplishments include implementing a robust back navigation system across all user journey steps, refining the AI stylist's conversational style to be more natural and concise, and overhauling product filtering logic to accurately display items based on budget ranges. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, utilizing troubleshooting agents to diagnose and resolve critical deployment issues like incorrect environment variables and invalid CSS classes. While implementing and later removing attract modes based on user feedback, the focus remained on core user experience and AI functionality. The most recent work involved adding a custom jewelry design option and resolving persistent product filtering issues by enriching the product database with diverse price ranges, culminating in the user providing new, official product data for integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on refining the product recommendation and filtering logic. The user reported that selecting different budget ranges was showing the same 4 products, indicating a problem with product diversity across price points. The engineer diagnosed this as a lack of products in higher price categories within the  data in .

To address this, the engineer:
1.  **Expanded Product Data:** Added a significant number of new, mock luxury products to  in  to ensure that all budget ranges (₹10K-₹60K, ₹60K-₹1L, ₹1L-₹2L, ₹2L-₹4L) had appropriate jewelry items. This included various types of rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, sets, and tiaras, some representing traditional Indian jewelry.
2.  **Integrated Custom Jewelry Option:** Introduced a Design Your Dream Piece card as the last recommendation option in the . This custom option features a Start Custom Design button that links to the Evol Jewels custom design service.
3.  **Modified Recommendation UI:** Updated  to dynamically render product cards, specifically differentiating the custom jewelry option with distinct styling and button text.

The user then provided a  file, indicating that these hardcoded mock products should now be replaced with actual Evol Jewels product data. The engineer acknowledged this and is poised to integrate this new, official product list.
