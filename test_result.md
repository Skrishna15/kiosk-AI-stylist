# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "✅ PURCHASE INTENT HANDLING FEATURE TESTING COMPLETE - COMPREHENSIVE VERIFICATION OF NEW PURCHASE GUIDANCE FUNCTIONALITY! Successfully tested the new purchase intent handling feature in the AI stylist chat that politely guides customers to scan QR codes for secure purchasing through Evol Jewels' website. Key findings: (1) PURCHASE INTENT DETECTION LOGIC: ✅ Comprehensive testing of detectPurchaseIntent function confirms accurate detection of purchase-related keywords including 'buy', 'purchase', 'price', 'cost', 'order', 'get this', 'want this', 'how much', 'available', 'in stock', 'can i get', 'interested in buying', 'where to buy', 'how to order', 'payment', 'checkout'. ✅ Correctly identifies purchase intent messages: 'I want to buy this piece' ✅, 'How much does this cost?' ✅, 'Can I purchase this?' ✅, 'Where can I order this?' ✅, 'I'm interested in buying' ✅, 'How to get this jewelry?' ✅. ✅ Correctly excludes non-purchase queries: 'How should I style this?' ❌, 'What celebrities wear this?' ❌. (2) ENHANCED QUICK QUESTIONS WITH PURCHASE INTENT: ✅ Product-specific chat includes purchase-related quick questions: 'How do I purchase this piece?' 💰, 'Is this available for order?' 💰, alongside celebrity styling questions. ✅ General chat includes purchase guidance questions: 'How can I buy these recommendations?' 💰, 'Where can I purchase these pieces?' 💰. ✅ All purchase-related quick questions properly integrated with celebrity stylist branding and functionality. (3) PURCHASE GUIDANCE RESPONSES: ✅ Product-specific purchase responses mention specific product name and price, guide users to QR code scanning process, reference 'Jewelry Passport' concept, direct to 'Evol Jewels' secure website', emphasize safe and secure purchasing. Example: 'I'm excited that you're interested in the Romance Diamond Ring! To purchase this beautiful piece securely, you can scan the QR code that will appear at the end of our consultation...' ✅ General purchase responses provide comprehensive guidance about QR code process and Jewelry Passport for all recommendations. (4) CELEBRITY STYLIST INTEGRATION: ✅ Purchase guidance seamlessly integrated with celebrity stylist experience, maintaining luxury positioning and red carpet glamour branding throughout purchase discussions. ✅ Purchase responses include celebrity-style language and maintain sophisticated tone consistent with luxury jewelry brand positioning. (5) QR CODE AND JEWELRY PASSPORT REFERENCES: ✅ All purchase responses correctly reference QR code scanning process, mention 'Jewelry Passport' concept for saved preferences, direct users to 'Evol Jewels' secure website', emphasize security and safety of purchase process. (6) NON-PURCHASE QUERY HANDLING: ✅ Non-purchase styling questions receive appropriate celebrity stylist responses without purchase guidance, maintaining natural conversation flow without being pushy about sales. (7) PURCHASE INTENT INTEGRATION IN EXISTING RESPONSES: ✅ AI responses naturally incorporate purchase guidance when appropriate, enhancing rather than disrupting the celebrity stylist consultation experience. The new purchase intent handling feature successfully transforms the AI chat into a sophisticated sales consultation tool while maintaining the luxury celebrity stylist experience and guiding customers toward secure purchasing through the established QR code and Jewelry Passport system."
